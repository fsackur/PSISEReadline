# PSISEReadline

[PSReadLine](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine) is a major advance for me. I use bck-i-search very frequently to search and invoke commands from my history (Ctrl-R in any modern powershell console).

However, it is not supported, and will not import, in ISE. (See: https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/issues/401)

I still use ISE because it's great for debugging and quick edits, so: this is my implementation of bck-i-search for ISE.
