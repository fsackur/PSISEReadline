# Testing

Testing this code with Pester is going to be unlike anything I have done before. I fully expect it to be difficult.

- By definition, testing must be conducted in ISE
- It's very much geared to the interactive case
- I cannot possibly think of every case
- this code is probably never going to be critical
- I'm not confident any tests could be run in a pipeline

I'm therefore going to just not bother, at least initially.

Should this code get widespread use, this decision will be reviewed.

## Alternatives considered

- Investigate something like Selenium to automate user actions
    - I still see this being high effort with uncertain payoff
