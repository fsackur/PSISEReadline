# Building the module

Desired end-state: automated test, build, and publish to gallery.

Milestones:

1. Condense module into single .psm1, for speed of import. Publish as release artifacts on Github
2. Testing. See [2. Testing](2. Testing.md), but we can do basic tests
3. Publish to gallery
4. Automate on PR merge

The biggest difficulty is choosing a tool - searching the gallery for *build* finds a lot of tools, about a quarter of which are applicable to Powershell projects.

The clear winners for activity, support, and applicability to Powershell are:

```
Name        : InvokeBuild
Description : Build and test automation in PowerShell
ProjectUri  : https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build
```

```
Name        : ModuleBuilder
Description : A module for authoring and building PowerShell modules
ProjectUri  : https://github.com/PoshCode/ModuleBuilder
```

Invoke-Build is related to the now-unsupported psake tool, and is genrally applicable for all code projects.

ModuleBuilder is more geared to applying best practices for Powershell projects. I find it to have more intent, and it is clearly more opinionated.

We will use ModuleBuilder to build the output artifacts.
